To update ffmpeg to the latest version:

1) download a shared and dev ffmpeg package from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ for 32 bit or 64 bit (depending on which version you want)
2) unzip the shared package and copy the bin folder and readme.txt file,into the ffmpeg or ffmpeg64 folder in the project
3) unzip the dev package and copy the include and lib folders into the ffmpeg or ffmpeg64 folder in the project

so it should be (use ffmpeg64 instead of ffmpeg if you are building a 64 bit version)

/ffmpeg/bin/
/ffmpeg/include/
/ffmpeg/lib/
/ffmpeg/readme.txt
